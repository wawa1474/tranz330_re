"I see that you had issues recovering S774/U11.
I attempted a reversing of this chip, I'd say it behaves like a PAL16R4
(so yes, it is registered). Attached you will find the equations, a JED
for a PAL16R4 and a GJD for a GAL16V8.
For what I could check, it behaves the same as the original chip, also,
when inserted in the 380 the thing boots, and can access the RTC fine
(did not try the modem)."

I've not yet tried these files in my own system, so I don't know if they work exactly like the original but this is a starting point.
