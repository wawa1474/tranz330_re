"had some time to play with the other two chips. Did not make extensive
tests, I just checked the following:
1. The chip generated with the new JED to produce the same outputs in my
analyzer (of course, the analyzer could be wrong)
2. The new chip gets the Tranz 380 up and running, at least for a
minimal test, booting it up and setting the rtc. I should do some
diagnostic, but did not have the time"

I've not yet tried these files in my own system, so I don't know if they work exactly like the original but this is a starting point.
