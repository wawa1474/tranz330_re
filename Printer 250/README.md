# Verifone Printer 250 Reverse Engineering
Partial reverse engineering of an old Z8-based serial printer

The Printer 250 has a Z8 microcontroller at its heart.

I want to end up with a reference that's useful for writing software.

# Systems Specs
* Z8 MPU at 11.0592 MHz
* RS-232 serial port, 8-pin DIN connector
